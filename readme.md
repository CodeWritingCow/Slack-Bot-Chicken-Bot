# Chicken Slack Bot

This chicken Slack bot answers the age-old question, "Why did the chicken cross the road?"

If you say "hi," "hello" or "howdy" to the bot, or mention its name ("chicken-bot"), it will respond with a chicken emoji!

For my bot's avatar, I used the image of a rooster by Fayforest Faces, resized for VX/Ace by [Granny's Lists](http://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?/topic/30456-grannys-lists-vxace-animal-sprites). It's not included in this repository ... Free feel to use your own image!

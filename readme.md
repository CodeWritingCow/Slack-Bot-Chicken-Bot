# Chicken Slack Bot

This chicken Slack bot answers the age-old question, "Why did the chicken cross the road?"
Based on the tutorial ["Learn How to make a bot for Slack with node.js"](https://www.eduonix.com/blog/web-programming-tutorials/learn-make-bot-slack-node-js) by Sabeer Shaikh.

For my bot's avatar, I used the image of a rooster by Fayforest Faces, resized for VX/Ace by [Granny's Lists](http://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?/topic/30456-grannys-lists-vxace-animal-sprites). It's not included in this repository ... Free feel to use your own image!
